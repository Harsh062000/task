Here are 5 popular Node.js-based API frameworks:

Express.js: Express.js is one of the most widely used Node.js frameworks for building APIs. It provides a
       minimalistic and flexible approach to web application development, making it easy to handle routing, 
       middleware, and HTTP requests.

Koa.js: Koa.js is a lightweight and modern web framework that uses async/await functions for handling middleware. 
       It is developed by the same team behind Express.js and offers a more streamlined and modular approach to 
       building APIs.

Nest.js: Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications. 
       It is built with TypeScript and provides a structured architectural pattern inspired by Angular, making it 
       easy to organize and maintain complex APIs.

Hapi.js: Hapi.js is a powerful and flexible framework for building APIs and web applications. It focuses on 
       configuration-driven development and offers a rich plugin ecosystem for easily adding functionality to your 
       API, such as authentication, input validation, and caching.

Fastify: Fastify is a highly efficient and low-overhead framework for building web applications and APIs. It boasts 
       incredibly fast performance, supports a wide range of plugins, and provides an intuitive API for handling 
       requests and responses.

These frameworks have gained popularity due to their robustness, ease of use, extensive community support, and 
active development. Each framework has its own unique features and advantages, so it's recommended to explore them 
further and choose the one that best fits your specific project requirements.

Here are the names of 5 public blockchains, 2 private blockchains, and 3 hybrid blockchains:

Public Blockchains:
1. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin is the first and most well-known public blockchain. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer 
       network that enables secure, transparent, and permissionless transactions using its native cryptocurrency, 
       Bitcoin (BTC).

2. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum is a public blockchain platform that introduced smart contracts and decentralized 
       applications (DApps). It supports the development and execution of smart contracts using its native 
       cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).

3. Binance Smart Chain (BSC): Binance Smart Chain is a public blockchain developed by the cryptocurrency exchange 
       Binance. It offers fast and low-cost transactions, making it popular for decentralized finance (DeFi) 
       applications.

4. Cardano (ADA): Cardano is a public blockchain platform that aims to provide a secure and scalable infrastructure 
       for the development of decentralized applications. It focuses on academic research and peer-reviewed 
       development.

5. Polkadot (DOT): Polkadot is a multi-chain network that enables the transfer of any type of data or asset across 
       different blockchains. It aims to create an interoperable ecosystem of specialized blockchains called 
       parachains.

Private Blockchains:
1. Hyperledger Fabric: Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source private blockchain framework hosted by the Linux 
       Foundation. It is designed for enterprise use cases, providing scalability, privacy, and permissioned access 
       control.

2. Corda: Corda is a distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform developed by R3. It is designed for businesses 
       and offers privacy and scalability features suitable for enterprise applications.

Hybrid Blockchains:
1. Ripple (XRP): Ripple is a hybrid blockchain and payment protocol that enables fast and low-cost international 
       money transfers. It combines elements of both public and private blockchains to facilitate efficient 
       cross-border transactions.

2. Ardor (ARDR): Ardor is a blockchain platform that operates as a parent-child chain system. The parent chain 
       provides security and consensus while child chains can have their own features and tokens, allowing for 
       scalability and customization.

3. Dragonchain (DRGN): Dragonchain is a hybrid blockchain platform that combines public and private blockchain 
       features. It offers scalable and secure solutions for businesses to develop and deploy smart contracts and 
       decentralized applications.

These blockchains represent a diverse range of use cases and technological approaches, catering to different 
needs in the blockchain ecosystem.
